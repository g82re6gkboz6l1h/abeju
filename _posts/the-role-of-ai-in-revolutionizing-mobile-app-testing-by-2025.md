## Why AI is Crucial for Mobile App Testing

Traditional mobile app testing involves manual and scripted techniques, which are increasingly unable to meet the demands of feature-rich, regularly updated apps. AI introduces a paradigm shift by automating repetitive tasks, recognizing patterns, predicting anomalies, and offering intelligent insights. AI tools can instantly generate test cases, perform real-world behavior simulations, and uncover hidden vulnerabilities. By 2025, AI-powered testing solutions will redefine QA processes, making them more efficient, scalable, and precise.
