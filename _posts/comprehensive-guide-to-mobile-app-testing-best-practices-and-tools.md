Types of Mobile App Testing

To ensure all aspects of an app are flawless, various testing methods must be applied:

### Functional Testing
Evaluates whether app features behave as intended, ensuring smooth user interaction.

### Usability Testing
Tests the ease of navigation, design structure, and responsiveness.

### Performance Testing
Measures app behavior under conditions such as heavy load, low resources, or slow networks.

### Compatibility Testing
Ensures seamless functionality across all devices and operating system versions.

### Security Testing
Prioritizes the identification of data vulnerabilities and ensures adherence to privacy regulations.

### Localization Testing
Validates the app’s readiness for different languages, regions, or cultural formats.

### Regression Testing
Checks that updates don't negatively impact existing features.

### Automated Testing
Speeds up the testing process using modern tools to handle repetitive tasks efficiently.
