## What is Mobile App Performance Testing?

Mobile app performance testing evaluates how your app behaves under real-world scenarios, checking for speed, scalability, reliability, and responsiveness. Unlike functional testing, which focuses on bugs, performance testing ensures user satisfaction by optimizing the app for extreme conditions.

### Key Objectives of Performance Testing:

- Verify app responsiveness (task completion time).
- Ensure reliability under peak loads.
- Improve scalability for growth.
- Detect and resolve performance bottlenecks.

Performance testing should be integrated into your app development lifecycle to deliver a seamless user experience, reduce maintenance costs, and retain users in competitive markets.

## Key Metrics to Track in Mobile App Performance Testing

### **1. Response Time**
Track the time your app takes to respond to user actions, such as opening screens or submitting requests. Achieve response times under 2 seconds to retain users.

### **2. API Latency**
High API latency can slow down your app. Ensure APIs fetch and display data quickly to maintain app performance.

### **3. Load Time**
The time your app takes to start and load its UI impacts user engagement. Optimize your load time for faster app launches.

### **4. Memory Usage**
Monitor your app’s memory consumption to avoid crashes and poor device performance while maintaining efficiency across different hardware.

### **5. Battery Usage**
Assess energy consumption to address battery-draining issues, a significant factor in user retention.

### **6. Concurrent Users**
Test your app by simulating high traffic loads to evaluate performance under stress and prepare for scalability needs during peak usage.

### **7. Error Rate**
Prevent high error rates by identifying issues in user interface, backend servers, or app design, improving app reliability.
