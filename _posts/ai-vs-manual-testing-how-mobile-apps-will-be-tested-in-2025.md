## The Evolution of Manual Testing by 2025

**Manual testing** has long been the cornerstone of software quality assurance. Through direct interaction with the app, testers have uncovered bugs and usability issues that automation tools often fail to capture. However, the increasing complexity of **mobile apps** has led to substantial changes in the manual testing space:

- **Time Constraints**: Modern agile methodologies demand faster releases, which makes manually testing every feature unsustainable.
- **Global Compatibility**: Testing must now span numerous devices, OS versions, and languages, a feat beyond human capacity alone.
- **Repetitive Work**: tediously repeating regression tests can introduce human error and slow workflows.

Come 2025, manual testing will transition into 
**creative, exploratory roles** leveraging human intuition and design-thinking, while relying on AI for repetitive and exhaustive tasks.
