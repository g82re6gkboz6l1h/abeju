Uncover issues across functionality, performance, and design with diverse testing methods:

### 1. Functional Testing
Validates app features (registration, transactions, notifications) by simulating user actions.

**Example**: Testing an e-commerce app’s payment gateway for seamless transactions.

---

### 2. Performance Testing
Examines app speed, responsiveness, and stability under varying load conditions.

**Example**: Evaluating app performance for 10,000 users accessing a flash sale.

---

### 3. Compatibility Testing
Ensures flawless performance across devices and screen sizes.

**Example**: Checking a messaging app’s scaling on smartphones and tablets.

---

### 4. Usability Testing
Reviews user-friendliness and navigation to optimize the app’s interface.

**Example**: Gathering user feedback to improve confusing UI elements.

---

### 5. Security Testing
Identifies vulnerabilities to protect user data against cyber threats.

**Example**: Assessing a banking app for secure encryption.

---

### 6. Network Testing
Tests app stability in fluctuating network environments.

**Example**: Running a streaming app under 3G, Wi-Fi, and intermittent connectivity.
