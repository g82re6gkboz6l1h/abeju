## The Evolution of Mobile App Testing

Mobile app testing has come a long way. Initially dominated by manual processes, today’s testing landscape prioritizes automation, speed, and efficiency. With the adoption of DevOps and agile methodologies, testing has “shifted left,” becoming a central component of the development life cycle. By integrating continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD), QA teams identify and resolve issues earlier than ever before. 

Looking to 2025, mobile app testers must be prepared to tackle cross-platform frameworks, 5G connectivity, IoT devices, and AR/VR interfaces. Staying ahead demands adaptability to new tools and methodologies.
