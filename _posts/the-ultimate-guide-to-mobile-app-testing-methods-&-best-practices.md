## Manual vs. Automated Mobile App Testing

Striking the right balance between manual and automated tests is vital to optimize resources and deliver quality results.

### Manual Testing:
- Perfect for **user experience assessments** and uncovering UX/UI issues too advanced for automation.
- Cost-effective for smaller teams but **time-intensive** for large-scale apps.

### Automation Testing:
- Automates tedious, repetitive tasks, ensuring scalability and **precision**.
- Paired well with tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) for AI-driven insights.

### Hybrid Approach:
Combine **manual testing** for nuanced metrics with the speed and accuracy of automation for best results.
