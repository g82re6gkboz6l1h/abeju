The Debate: Automated vs Manual Testing

Choosing the right testing methodology depends on your app’s requirements.

### Automated Testing
Automated solutions excel in repetitive and scalable scenarios:
- **Speed**: Execute hundreds of test cases simultaneously, reducing cycles.
- **Consistency**: Eliminate human error for reliable testing outcomes.
- **Expansion**: Streamline large-scale testing across platforms.

### Manual Testing
When human intuition is crucial, manual processes excel:
- **Contextual Feedback**: Detect subtle UX flaws that automation may overlook.
- **Flexibility**: Adapt low-structured scenarios, ideal for unique bug searches.

### Hybrid Testing
Combine automation efficiency with manual insights using hybrid solutions. [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) exemplifies this seamless approach.
