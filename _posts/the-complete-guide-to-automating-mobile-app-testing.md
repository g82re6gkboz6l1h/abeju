## Why Automate Mobile Testing?

Manually testing across multiple devices and platforms is time-consuming and unsustainable. Automation simplifies the process, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and faster development cycles. Automating testing helps with:

- **Regression Testing**: Ensure updates don’t affect existing features.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate app performance under high user load.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test compatibility across iOS and Android.
- **CI/CD**: Automate tests to speed up deployments.
