## What Is AI-Driven Automation in Mobile App Testing?

AI-driven automation combines machine learning with testing methodologies to create intelligent, self-adaptive systems. Unlike basic automation, AI systems continuously learn from historical data, workflows, and real-time app behavior. These innovations radically reduce manual intervention, predict potential errors, and adapt to changes dynamically, challenging the limitations of traditional frameworks.

### AI-Driven Testing Features 
- **Intelligent Test Generation:** Create relevant test cases based on user analytics and app logic.
- **Self-Healing Scripts:** AI adapts scripts to interface changes, without manual updates.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Spot vulnerabilities before they become bugs.

AI provides precision and efficiency, allowing teams to dedicate their efforts to crafting seamless experiences that delight users.
