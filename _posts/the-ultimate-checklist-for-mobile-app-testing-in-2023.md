## Functional Testing Essentials for Mobile Apps

Functional testing verifies your app works as intended. Here’s what to focus on:

1. **Installation Testing**: Check seamless app installation, updates, and deletions across devices and OS versions.
2. **Login and Authentication**: Ensure secure login, multi-factor authentication, password resets, and third-party integrations like Google/Facebook.
3. **UI and Navigation Testing**: Guarantee intuitive navigation and flawless UI responsiveness across platforms.
4. **Feature-specific Testing**: Test critical features like search, notifications, payments, and offline usability.
5. **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure apps support various screen resolutions, devices, and browsers through real devices and emulators.

Mobile App Performance Testing Best Practices

Performance directly impacts user retention and engagement. Optimize performance through:

1. **Load Time Checks**: Aim for fast app launches and on-screen content rendering.
2. **Stress Testing**: Simulate peak loads to pinpoint points of failure and improve response times.
3. **Battery and Memory Testing**: Minimize app-induced battery drain and memory overconsumption.
4. **Network Testing**: Check app behavior under weak or slow connections, and simulate offline usage.
5. **Crash Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities by simulating abrupt shutdowns or unusual usage scenarios.

Proactive performance testing prevents negative user experiences and ensures scalability.
