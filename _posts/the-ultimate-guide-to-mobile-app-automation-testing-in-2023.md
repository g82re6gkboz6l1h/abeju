## What Is Mobile App Automation Testing?

Mobile app automation testing involves utilizing specialized tools and software frameworks to test mobile applications automatically for performance, usability, security, and reliability. Unlike manual testing, automation leverages scripts and AI-supported bots to run repetitive test cases consistently and efficiently.

With the increase in device types, operating systems (iOS, Android), and various app categories (native, hybrid, and mobile web apps), automated testing ensures that apps are compatible across platforms and meet user expectations. In 2023, technologies like AI and machine learning have made automation testing faster and smarter, with innovative platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) streamlining the process even more.
