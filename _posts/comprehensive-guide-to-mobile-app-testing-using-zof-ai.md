## 1. What is Mobile App Testing?

Mobile app testing is the backbone of any app development process, ensuring an application functions flawlessly and meets user expectations. It identifies and resolves issues before launch by testing the app in various settings, including devices, operating systems, and network conditions.

### Key Types of Mobile App Testing

1. **Functional Testing**: Evaluates whether app features operate seamlessly.
2. **Performance Testing**: Tests the app's speed, responsiveness, and scalability under different conditions.
3. **Usability Testing**: Analyzes UI and UX, ensuring positive user interaction.
4. **Compatibility Testing**: Validates the app across various device models, screen sizes, and operating systems.
5. **Security Testing**: Safeguards sensitive user data by tackling vulnerabilities.

Manual testing often proves time-consuming and susceptible to human error. This is where AI shines in elevating testing to the next level.
