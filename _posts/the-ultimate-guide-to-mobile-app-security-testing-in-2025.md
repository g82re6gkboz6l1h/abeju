## Why Mobile App Security Testing Matters More Than Ever

By 2025, mobile apps are critical infrastructures for IoT devices, online services, and AI-driven systems. Cybercriminals increasingly target them, risking significant financial losses, legal ramifications, and consumer trust. Three major challenges define today’s app security landscape:

1. **IoT-Connected Apps Vulnerabilities**: With IoT integration, a compromise in one app can jeopardize connected device networks.
2. **Stricter Privacy Regulations**: Frameworks like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA impose severe penalties for non-compliance.
3. **AI-Driven Threats**: AI mechanisms fuel advanced attacks, demanding AI-powered security solutions.
