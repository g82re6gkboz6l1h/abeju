## Traditional Testing Challenges That Slow You Down

Before detailing the benefits of Zof AI, let’s highlight key challenges in conventional app testing:

### 1. **Time-Consuming Manual Testing**
Testing apps across multiple platforms and frequent updates takes weeks, while coding automated scripts also eats away significant time.

### 2. **Human Error and Bias**
Manual QA testing often misses subtle issues, especially during repetitive testing cycles or when under time constraints.

### 3. **Infrastructure Demands**
Teams require extensive infrastructure (devices or emulators) to support multi-device test scenarios, driving costs higher.

### 4. **Struggles to Scale**
Expanding testing workflows for apps with growing user bases is challenging, creating bottlenecks during simultaneous large-scale tests.
