## Key Challenges in Cross-Platform Mobile App Testing

While cross-platform apps simplify development, testing presents unique challenges:

1. **Device and OS Fragmentation:** Compatibility across varying screen sizes, resolutions, and operating systems (legacy and new) is complex.
2. **Performance Consistency:** Apps must perform consistently, regardless of device capabilities.
3. **UI/UX Disparities:** An interface that looks excellent on iOS could present inconsistencies on Android.
4. **Third-Party Plugins:** APIs and integrations need validation for uniform functionality across all environments.
5. **Localization Testing:** Global apps require seamless functionality for diverse formats, languages, and cultural differences.

Careful planning and effective testing strategies are essential to overcome these hurdles.
