## Understanding Manual and Automated Testing

### What is Manual Testing?
- **Human Interaction**: Executed by testers who behave as actual users, manually identifying design and usability issues.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for exploratory testing, usability checks, and tests requiring subjective assessment.

### What is Automated Testing?
- **Tool-Based Execution**: Automated scripts and tools run repetitive test cases across devices without human oversight.
- **Use Cases**: Perfect for regression testing, performance testing, and handling scalability challenges efficiently.

Both methods contribute significantly to quality assurance, but understanding when and how to use them ensures efficient workflows and enhanced app performance.
