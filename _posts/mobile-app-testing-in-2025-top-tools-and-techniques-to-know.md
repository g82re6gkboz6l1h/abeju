## Traditional vs. AI-Powered Tools Like Zof AI

### The Legacy of Traditional Testing Tools

Traditional testing tools like Appium, Selenium, and TestComplete have long been go-to solutions for mobile app testing. These platforms enable developers and QA teams to conduct automation testing, simulate user behavior, and verify app workflows. Their pre-defined scripts successfully address many general scenarios.

Yet in 2025, the advent of dynamic user interfaces (UIs), AI-based personalization, and complex algorithms means traditional methods may falter in scalability and adaptability. The manual effort required for scripting and maintaining thousands of test cases is becoming impractical amid the new landscape.
