## Crucial Metrics for Evaluating App Performance

When testing apps, developers focus on metrics showcasing quality and performance reliability:

### 1. **Latency**
Target minimal app latency, especially for real-time applications like gaming or streaming, as 5G users demand instant operations.

### 2. **Load Time**
Apps need to load within 2 seconds to meet 2025’s heightened user expectations.

### 3. **Error Rate**
Identify error-prone areas through comprehensive crash tests to retain users.

### 4. **Throughput**
Measure data transfer rates to optimize apps handling heavy data traffic.

### 5. **Scalability**
Ensure scalability for spikes in user activity, especially during high-demand events.

### 6. **Battery Efficiency**
Optimize energy consumption for devices with limited power capacity.

### 7. **Network Behavior**
Compatibility with 3G, 4G LTE, 5G, and offline networks is a non-negotiable requirement.
