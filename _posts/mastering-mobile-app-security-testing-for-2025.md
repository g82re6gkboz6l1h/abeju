## Why Mobile App Security Testing is More Crucial Than Ever

With mobile apps serving as ecosystems for banking, healthcare, IoT, and e-commerce, their growing complexity leaves them open to cyberattacks. In 2025, data breaches stemming from apps can lead to the exposure of millions of users' personal data, including financial information and identifiers. New compliance standards such as GDPR updates and the AI Act of 2025 mean heavier penalties for data protection failures. Therefore, proactive security testing isn’t optional—it’s imperative to safeguard user trust and brand reputation.
