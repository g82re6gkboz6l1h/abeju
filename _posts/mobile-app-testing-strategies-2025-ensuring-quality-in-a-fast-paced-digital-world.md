## Challenges in Modern Mobile QA

### Device Fragmentation
Thousands of configurations, particularly within Android devices, and frequent iOS updates make maintaining consistent performance difficult.

### Ultrafast Release Timelines
Continuous deployment demands agile, reliable frameworks capable of thorough testing within short cycles.

### Security and Global Accessibility
Growing concerns about privacy and the globalization of apps require advanced measures to address cultural, multilingual, and regional connectivity challenges.
