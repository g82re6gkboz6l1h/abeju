## Understanding the Shift in Mobile App Testing

Mobile app testing began as manual processes, where testers identified bugs and inconsistencies across devices and systems. While beneficial for smaller applications, manual testing was unsustainable for complex applications with frequent updates. Automation tools were introduced to streamline repetitive tasks, enabling faster regression testing, compatibility checks, and performance analysis.

Despite improvements, traditional methods struggled to scale. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling proactive testing approaches—predicting and preventing issues while optimizing user experiences in real time.
