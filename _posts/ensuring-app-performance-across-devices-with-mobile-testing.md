## Handle Device Variability Effectively

From screen sizes to OS versions, understanding device variability is critical. Apps behave differently across devices, and optimizing for each type leads to improved user satisfaction.

### Key Factors to Address:
- **Operating System Versions:** Ensure backward compatibility across outdated and modern versions of Android and iOS.
- **Device Hardware:** Test screen resolutions, pixel densities, and processing power for optimal performance.
- **Network Differences:** Ensure apps can handle varying network speeds (2G to 5G, Wi-Fi).
- **Processor and RAM Restrictions:** Test for app responsiveness on low-end devices to avoid performance bottlenecks.

Prioritize testing strategies that adapt to these device-specific challenges.
