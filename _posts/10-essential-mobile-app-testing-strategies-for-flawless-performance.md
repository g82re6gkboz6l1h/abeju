## Key Types of Mobile App Testing

A flawless app requires multiple types of testing. Here's an overview of crucial mobile testing categories:

### 1. Functional Testing
Verifies core functionalities and features operate as intended. For example, banking apps require reliable checks for functions like transfers and statement generation.

### 2. Usability Testing
Assesses overall user experience, ensuring intuitive navigation, appealing aesthetics, and effortless workflows.

### 3. Compatibility Testing
Checks app performance across diverse devices, screen sizes, and operating systems (e.g., smartphones vs. tablets).

### 4. Performance Testing
Evaluates app responsiveness under varying conditions like heavy traffic and low memory. Metrics include load times, battery usage, and API response speed.

### 5. Security Testing
Identifies vulnerabilities to safeguard sensitive data like payments and personal information.

### 6. Localization Testing
Ensures proper adaptation of language, currency, date formats, and cultural nuances for localized regions.
