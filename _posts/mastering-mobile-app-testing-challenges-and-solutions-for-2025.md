## Top Challenges QA Teams Must Tackle by 2025

### 1. **Device Fragmentation**
The expanding diversity of iOS, Android, and other systems introduces challenges with screen variations, hardware, and operating systems. This fragmentation demands scalable testing processes.

### 2. **Full Coverage Across Network Variances**
Global apps must function flawlessly under varying network conditions—whether during high latency events or slower connections.

### 3. **Security and Compliance Testing**
Data breaches and privacy concerns have increased with cloud and AI integrations. Apps must follow robust compliance protocols like GDPR.

### 4. **Performance Metrics Optimization**
QA teams must verify minimal loading times, efficient resource use, and efficient performance even under taxing scenarios.

### 5. **Mastering AI and Automation**
Advanced tools, such as AI platforms or automation scripts, will play a critical role in testing the complexity of machine-learning-powered apps autonomously.
