## How AI is Transforming Mobile QA

Traditional QA methods rely on manual or automated testing. Manual testing, while intuitive, is inefficient and prone to human error, while automated testing lacks adaptability for dynamic mobile apps. 

AI bridges these gaps through predictive analytics, pattern recognition, and learning capabilities. By simulating millions of user journeys and identifying potential failures, AI-powered testing ensures bug-free, user-friendly apps. It also scales with the growing complexity of mobile technology, adapting to new challenges in QA.
