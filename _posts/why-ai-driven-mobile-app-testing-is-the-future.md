## Challenges with Traditional Mobile App Testing Approaches

Traditional mobile app testing has limitations. Here's why embracing AI-driven testing is critical:

### 1. **Time-Consuming Processes**
Manual regression testing can prolong deployment times and create bottlenecks, slowing app launches.

### 2. **Limited Test Coverage**
Human testers often overlook edge cases, raising the risk of bugs in live applications.

### 3. **Device Fragmentation**
With countless device combinations, it’s unrealistic for manual testing to guarantee compatibility across all environments.

### 4. **Error Prone**
Human error during manual testing increases the risk of missed issues.

### 5. **High Costs**
Extensive manual testing demands larger QA teams and higher operational budgets.

AI-driven testing solutions address these challenges with unparalleled efficiency.
