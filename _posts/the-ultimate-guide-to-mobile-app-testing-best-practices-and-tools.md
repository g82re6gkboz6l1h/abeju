## Introduction to Mobile App Testing

### What is Mobile App Testing?
Mobile app testing encompasses the systematic evaluation of an app to ensure reliability, security, and user satisfaction. It guarantees seamless operation on various devices, screen sizes, and network conditions. Robust testing is crucial, considering the hardware diversity and OS fragmentation of mobile environments.

### Why Mobile App Testing is Critical?
With millions of apps competing for attention, users uninstall nearly 75% of apps in their first week due to performance issues. Rigorous testing not only reduces bugs but ensures exceptional user experiences, protects brand reputation, and minimizes costs of reactive fixes.
