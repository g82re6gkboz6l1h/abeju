## How AI is Redefining App Testing

Historically, app testing relied on manual processes and outdated automation techniques. These methods involved extensive human efforts prone to errors, scalability challenges, and hefty maintenance burdens as apps evolved. Traditional automation tools also required continuous revisions, complicating workflows.

AI disrupts these limitations by leveraging machine learning (ML), predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP). These technologies amplify app testing with intelligent data analysis, adaptable testing strategies, and superior error detection capabilities. AI transforms testing from reactive quality checks into progressive development practices, where apps evolve dynamically based on user needs and behavior.
