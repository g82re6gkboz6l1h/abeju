## What is Mobile App Testing?

Mobile app testing involves verifying that applications for smartphones and tablets function as designed. It ensures compatibility across devices, robust performance, tight security, and smooth user experience. Given the complexity of mobile technology—such as varying operating systems, screen sizes, and hardware—rigorous testing is essential.

**Key App Categories:**

1. **Native Apps**: Built exclusively for a specific OS (e.g., iOS, Android).
2. **Web Apps**: Accessible via mobile browsers, offering web-based functionality.
3. **Hybrid Apps**: A mix of native and web apps, running on multiple platforms.

Each type requires customized QA strategies for comprehensive testing.
