## Top Challenges in Mobile App Testing (2025 Edition)

Mobile app testing still faces hurdles despite technological advancements:

### 1. **Device & Platform Fragmentation**
With a vast array of devices, screen sizes, and operating systems, ensuring compatibility remains a significant challenge.

### 2. **Lack of Resources**
Companies often deal with resource constraints—whether limited hardware or experienced testers—compromising testing quality.

### 3. **Manual vs. Automated Testing**
Relying on error-prone manual testing over automation leads to inconsistencies. Although automation tools exist, their adoption is uneven.

### 4. **Real-World Simulation Gaps**
Testing real-world scenarios, like unstable networks or multiple users, is often neglected, leading to poor app performance.

### 5. **Emerging Technologies**
As apps incorporate AI, IoT, and AR/VR, testing these advanced functionalities requires tools that match the complexity of modern apps.
