## 4 Key Challenges in Mobile App Testing

### 1. Device & OS Fragmentation
Testing for compatibility across thousands of devices and variations of Android and iOS platforms is resource-intensive. Some apps may run smoothly on specific devices but fail on others due to technical nuances.

### 2. Accelerated Development Cycles
Agile/DevOps practices mean rapid development, but QA teams often struggle with limited time for rigorous app testing, leading to skipped tests and post-release bugs.

### 3. Meeting High User Expectations
Consumers demand flawless functionality with fast, engaging performance. Identifying and resolving user experience (UX) issues across different usage environments is challenging.

### 4. Expanding Test Scope
As app features multiply, the testing needs grow exponentially. Manual testers face difficulties managing test data, creating diverse cases, and catching human errors efficiently.
