## Key Mobile Testing Trends Predicted for 2025

### 1. Continuous Testing in DevOps Pipelines
The adoption of Continuous Testing (CT) within DevOps workflows will rise with the growing reliance on CI/CD. Testing at every development stage will catch bugs early, reduce market timelines, and lower development costs.

### 2. Mainstream Adoption of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD, where test cases are written before coding, will become a norm by 2025. This approach ensures better code quality and fosters collaboration between QA and developers.

### 3. Shift-Right Testing Emergence
Testing post-deployment will increase. Shift-right testing emphasizes real-world performance monitoring and integrates user-driven feedback into the quality assurance process.

### 4. Real-Device Testing Remains Vital
While virtual testing tools are evolving, real-device testing will continue to be crucial for delivering highly personalized and device-specific app experiences.
