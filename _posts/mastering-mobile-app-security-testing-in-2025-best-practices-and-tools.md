## Why Mobile App Security Testing Matters

### Cyber Risks Are On the Rise
Modern mobile apps handle valuable data like passwords, payment information, and biometric data. With a 60% increase in app-based cyberattacks from 2023 to 2024, mobile app vulnerabilities like unprotected APIs, insecure integrations, and weak encryption attract hackers.

In light of this, comprehensive security testing is critical—not only for avoiding financial damage and legal fines but also for protecting your reputation and user trust.

### Small Businesses Aren’t Exempt
While big tech companies are common targets, startups and small businesses increasingly face attacks, amplifying the need for universal security measures.

## Regulations Deepen Developer Accountability in 2025

### Stricter Privacy Laws Worldwide
Regulations like the updated GDPR, new CCPA amendments, and sector-specific mandates (HIPAA, PCI DSS) demand stronger encryption, faster breach reporting, and heightened accountability for data protection.

### Legal Compliance as a Best Practice
The penalties for non-compliance are growing. Comprehensive testing frameworks aligned with evolving laws are now mandatory to ensure security and avoid hefty fines.
