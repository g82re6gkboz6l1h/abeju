## What is AI in Mobile App Testing?

AI in mobile app testing involves leveraging advanced algorithms, machine learning models, and automation to optimize the entire QA cycle. Manual testing traditionally depends on predefined checklists and static scripts, which can be rigid and error-prone. AI, on the other hand, introduces intelligent automation that effortlessly adapts to the evolving complexity of applications. It predicts bugs, analyzes patterns, and simulates real-world user behavior.

With AI tools like Zof AI, teams can accelerate their testing processes, boost coverage, and minimize human error, making the QA phase faster and more effective.
