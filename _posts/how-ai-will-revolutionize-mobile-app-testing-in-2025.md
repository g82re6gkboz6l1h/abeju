## Why AI is a Game-Changer in Mobile App Testing

AI's role in software development is rapidly evolving. By leveraging machine learning, predictive modeling, and natural language processing (NLP), AI detects bugs, predicts app failures, and automates repetitive testing. Unlike manual testing prone to human error or static automation tools, AI integrates cognitive capabilities, adapting test processes in real-time for dynamic evolutionary needs.
