## What AI Brings to Mobile App Testing

Artificial Intelligence uses techniques such as machine learning and neural networks to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Within mobile app testing, AI tackles complex challenges, including finding bugs and predicting regressions before they appear.

### Challenges in Traditional Mobile App Testing:
1. **App Complexity**: Modern features like AR, machine learning, and cloud services add layers of complexity.
2. **Platform Diversity**: Apps must perform seamlessly across operating systems, devices, and hardware configurations.
3. **Speed Demands**: Quick releases are critical, but without compromising on quality.

AI-driven tools address these issues through intelligent automation. By simulating user interactions and predicting failure points, AI minimizes manual effort and adapts dynamically to changes, making it the perfect ally in today's demanding development ecosystem.
