## Why AI Is Disrupting Mobile App Testing

Traditional software testing involves manual scripting, which is slow and prone to human error. Even with automation tools like Selenium, script maintenance requires extensive oversight—an area where AI excels. With machine learning and natural language processing capabilities, AI-driven QA tools identify patterns, optimize performance, and adapt to rapidly evolving scenarios without human intervention. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are harnessing this power to eliminate inefficiencies and improve outcomes in the testing lifecycle.
