## Why AI is Critical for Mobile QA in 2025  
The increasingly complex mobile ecosystem requires smarter QA. Here’s why traditional testing methods are struggling:

1. **Device Fragmentation**: Manual testing across countless device combinations is impractical.  
2. **High Expectations**: Customers demand flawless, bug-free applications.   
3. **Agile & CI/CD Challenges**: QA must adapt to continuous releases without delays.  
4. **Difficulty Simulating User Scenarios**: Understanding unpredictable user interactions remains a hurdle.  

AI excels where these methods fall short. By automating repetitive tasks, analyzing user behavior, and offering predictive feedback, AI tools like **Zof AI** tackle these challenges with unmatched precision and scalability.
