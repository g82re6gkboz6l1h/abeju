## Understanding AI-Powered Testing 

AI-powered testing revolutionizes traditional Quality Assurance (QA) methods. Unlike standard approaches, AI tools are dynamic, intelligent, and equipped with machine learning capabilities that enable continuous improvement. Time-consuming manual testing becomes a relic as AI guarantees efficient and accurate results, enhancing the speed and scalability of app testing workflows.

By using predictive models, machine-learning algorithms mimic real-world user behavior, conduct comprehensive exploratory tests, and prevent bugs proactively rather than reactively. Early identification of defects drives faster resolutions, mitigating costly production errors and aligning with agile development models.
