## What is Mobile App Testing

Mobile app testing involves evaluating an app’s performance, security, usability, functionality, and compatibility across diverse devices and operating systems. It ensures a seamless user experience and identifies issues before the app is released to users. Here's an overview of the core aspects:

### Functional Testing
Checks if all app features work as intended. For instance, if your app has a login screen, functional testing ensures users can successfully log in.

### Performance Testing
Examines how the app behaves under heavy usage, network speed variations, or restricted device memory.

### Usability Testing
Assesses how user-friendly the app is by testing its design, navigation, and meeting user expectations.

### Compatibility Testing
Ensures the app runs smoothly across various operating systems, devices, and screen sizes.

### Security Testing
Identifies vulnerabilities, safeguarding data from unauthorized access or exposure.

Effective mobile app testing drives quality assurance and makes apps ready for real-world challenges.
