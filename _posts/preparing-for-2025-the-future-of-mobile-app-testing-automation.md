## Automation in App Testing: An Overview 

Mobile app testing remains a vital part of the software development lifecycle. Historically, manual testing dominated quality assurance (QA) processes, but its limitations—such as inefficiency and inability to scale—have paved the way for automated testing. Automation uses tools and scripts to execute repetitive testing tasks, granting teams more time to focus on innovation.

Popular tools like Selenium and Appium have become mainstays in automated regression and performance testing. Yet, with AI, automation is becoming smarter and more adaptive, marking a dramatic shift as we near 2025. AI-powered test platforms, including Zof AI, are ushering in an era of unparalleled precision and scalability in quality assurance processes.
