## Why Cross-Platform Compatibility is Critical for Mobile Apps

In today’s competitive landscape, cross-platform compatibility is no longer optional—it’s mandatory. Apps must perform uniformly across iOS, Android, Windows, and IoT platforms to meet user expectations and avoid pitfalls like poor reviews and lost revenue. Learn why testing is vital:

1. **Diverse Device Ecosystem**: Adaptability to screen sizes, resolutions, and input methods becomes challenging as foldable devices and wearables grow in popularity.

2. **Global Accessibility**: Apps must perform optimally across high-end and cost-effective devices, even in varied network environments.

3. **Cost Savings**: Cross-platform frameworks like Flutter and React Native offer cost-effective solutions but require extensive testing for consistent functionality.

Cross-platform compatibility testing ensures apps remain reliable, enabling developers to surpass user expectations and technological hurdles as we approach 2025.
