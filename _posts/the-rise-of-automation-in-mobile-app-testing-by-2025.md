## Revolutionary Impact of Automation on Mobile App Testing

In the early days, mobile app testing was predominantly manual, requiring testers to carefully evaluate every app feature. However, as development accelerated under methodologies like Agile and DevOps, manual testing showed inefficiencies. Automation became the definitive solution to these challenges by enabling repetitive test cases to be executed seamlessly, unlocking productivity and reducing human error.

By 2025, nearly 80% of testing globally will be automated, with advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) driving these workflows. Intelligent platforms, such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), lead this evolution by enabling predictive testing and transforming QA strategies.
