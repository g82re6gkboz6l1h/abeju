## Why AI is Crucial in Mobile App Testing

Traditional testing methods like manual testing can’t keep pace with today’s demands. Expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error, these old approaches fall short with dynamic, constantly updated apps. Even automated scripts need frequent adjustments.

AI changes the game. By deploying machine learning, AI identifies patterns, predicts issues, and detects bugs in real-time without relying on rigid scripts. For instance, [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) ensures faster bug detection with fewer false positives by continuously learning and improving.

AI-powered platforms perform functional testing, UI validation, performance monitoring, and more—making them indispensable in modern quality assurance (QA).
