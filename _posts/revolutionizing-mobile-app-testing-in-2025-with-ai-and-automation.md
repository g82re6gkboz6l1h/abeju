## The Drawbacks of Traditional Mobile App Testing

Traditional QA methods, often reliant on manual testing or basic automation tools, are riddled with challenges:

- **Time-Consuming:** Manual testing demands significant effort to simulate countless scenarios across diverse devices, operating systems, and network conditions. The labor-intensive nature of manual testing lengthens the app release cycle.
  
- **Scalability Issues:** Legacy testing methods struggle to meet the sheer volume of devices and apps, delaying rollouts and increasing operational costs.

- **Human Error:** Manual testers can inadvertently miss rare edge cases or complex bugs, posing quality and security challenges.

- **Inefficiency in Regression Testing:** Frequent updates introduce the need for regression testing, often a bottleneck in traditional methodologies.

These inefficiencies have hampered the speed and accuracy required for app development. However, 2025’s AI and automation breakthroughs are reshaping app testing dynamics.
