## Challenges in Cross-Platform Mobile Testing

1. **Device Fragmentation**: Testing becomes complex as numerous device models, OS versions, and configurations exist—especially in the Android ecosystem.
2. **Hardware and OS Variability**: Performance issues arise due to unique platform features that aren’t uniformly supported.
3. **Platform-Specific Features**: Limitations in frameworks impact the integration of native functionalities.
4. **UI/UX Consistency**: Discrepancies appear due to differing design principles, such as Material Design vs. Human Interface Guidelines.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Achieving consistent performance across platforms requires specialized tests.
6. **Network Conditions**: Variability in connectivity affects syncing and data exchange.
