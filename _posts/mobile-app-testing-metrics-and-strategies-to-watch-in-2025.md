## Critical Metrics for Evaluating Mobile Apps in 2025

Tracking the right metrics is crucial for creating seamless app experiences. Here are vital app evaluation metrics to watch:

### 1. Performance Metrics
- **App Load Time**: Speed is critical; users expect apps to load in under 2 seconds.
- **Crash-Free Rate**: A reliable app should aim for a crash-free rate of over 99.5%.
- **Network Latency**: Minimizing real-time data exchange delays is key, especially with 5G.
- **Battery Consumption**: Apps that conserve battery life prevent uninstalls.

### 2. Usability Metrics
- **Time to First Interaction (TTFI)**: Faster TTFI boosts user engagement.
- **Task Completion Rate**: Reflects app ease-of-use.
- **Retention Rate**: Indicates long-term user satisfaction.

### 3. Security Metrics
- **Authentication Speed**: Biometric and secure login processes must balance speed and security.
- **Vulnerability Alerts**: Tracking and resolving vulnerabilities promptly is critical.
