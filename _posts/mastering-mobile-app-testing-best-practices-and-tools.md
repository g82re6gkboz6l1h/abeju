## Top Challenges in Mobile App Testing
Despite its importance, mobile testing poses unique challenges. Key issues include:

### 1. **Device Fragmentation**
Testing on all devices is unrealistic. Teams must focus efforts on popular devices and OS versions.

### 2. **Continuous OS Updates**
New updates can disrupt compatibility; regular maintenance testing is required.

### 3. **Variable Network Conditions**
Apps must adapt to setups like weak signals or ever-changing bandwidths.

### 4. **Resource Limitations**
Testing tools, environments, and device access can be costly.

### 5. **High User Expectations**
Users demand flawless performance; failing their expectations can hurt app retention.
