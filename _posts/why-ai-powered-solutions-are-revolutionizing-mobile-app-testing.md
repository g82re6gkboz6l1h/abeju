## The Challenges of Traditional Mobile App Testing

Mobile applications dominate the tech world, with millions available across iOS and Android platforms. Developers face constant pressure to release bug-free, responsive apps compatible with a diverse range of devices and operating systems. However, traditional testing methods, such as **manual testing**, come with notable drawbacks:

- **Error-Prone Results:** Manual testers are susceptible to human errors, especially during repetitive tasks.
- **Limited Scalability:** Testing across multiple devices and platforms becomes infeasible without automation.
- **Slow Iteration Cycles:** Manual testing delays regression and compatibility checks, stalling updates and fixes.
- **Performance Metric Limitations:** Identifying issues like lag, crashes, or high battery consumption without automation can lead to overlooked weaknesses.

These shortcomings make it challenging to balance speed and quality—necessitating a game-changer like AI.
