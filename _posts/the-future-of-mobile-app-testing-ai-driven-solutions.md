## How Mobile App Testing Has Changed

Mobile app testing has transformed from manual labor to automated solutions over the years. Early manual methods faced inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly with the rapid explosion of device types and app complexity. Automated tools like Selenium and Appium alleviated some of these pain points but still required human intervention. Today, AI brings unprecedented advancements in predictive analytics, intelligent testing, and adaptive learning, reducing errors, enhancing flexibility, and accelerating testing cycles.
