## Common Mobile App Testing Challenges

Here’s why mobile app testing is more complex than ever:

1. **Device Fragmentation:** Thousands of devices exist, each with unique configurations and screen resolutions.
2. **Evolving Operating Systems:** Operating systems like iOS and Android receive regular updates, demanding apps to work on both the latest and older versions.
3. **Real-World Scenarios:** Apps must perform well across varying network conditions, device behaviors, and user interactions.
4. **Time-Intensive Testing Process:** Manual tests can be exhausting, causing delays and errors.
5. **Limitations with Emulators:** Virtual testing environments often fail to fully replicate real-device performance.

These difficulties emphasize the need for smart tools like Zof AI.
