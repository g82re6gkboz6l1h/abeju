## The Rise of AI-Powered Testing Tools

Historically, app testing relied heavily on manual methods, later replaced by automated tools like Selenium and Appium. However, these tools demand technical expertise and fail to address large-scale or adaptive challenges.

The 2020s ushered in AI-powered tools that could predict failures, analyze devices, and adapt tests dynamically. Zof AI pushes this innovation further with self-learning models, ensuring robust testing aligned with trends, including 5G, AR/VR, and future app ecosystems.
