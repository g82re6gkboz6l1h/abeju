## What is Continuous Testing, and Why Does it Matter?

### 1. Satisfying Rising User Expectations  
Users expect apps to deliver flawless performance. Issues like slow loading times or frequent crashes result in uninstalls. Continuous testing ensures stability and optimal performance, increasing user satisfaction.

### 2. Managing Multidevice and Omnichannel Usage  
Apps must work across various device models, operating systems, and screen sizes. Continuous testing replicates these user environments to maintain functionality and consistency.

### 3. Accelerating Development in a Fast-Paced Market  
Agile methodologies and DevOps pipelines demand faster releases. Continuous testing integrates automated feedback loops, streamlining bug identification and resolution for quicker deployments.

### 4. Adapting to Emerging Technologies  
Advanced features such as AI, AR, and IoT integrations require real-time and automated testing processes to ensure smooth implementation. Continuous testing is crucial to support these complex functionalities.
