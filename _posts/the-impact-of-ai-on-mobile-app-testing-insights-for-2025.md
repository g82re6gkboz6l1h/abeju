## What AI is Doing for App Testing

Traditional app testing, riddled with lengthy processes and human errors, is being replaced by AI-powered methods. Through **machine learning (ML)** and **predictive analytics**, AI overcomes challenges like increasing device diversity and rapidly changing user demands. AI-driven testing tools streamline processes such as **regression tests**, which once took weeks, into hours. These tools autonomously simulate real-world scenarios and identify hard-to-find bugs like performance glitches or device-specific crashes.

By effectively detecting and predicting defects, these advancements promise **seamless user experiences** in apps by 2025. Automated frameworks powered by AI ensure app quality, minimize manual errors, and adapt to the evolving demands of global markets.
